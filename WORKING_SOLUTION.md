# WORKING AUTOMATION SOLUTION

## Approach

1. Create vault using BASIC factory (proven to work)
2. Enable automation features through separate function calls
3. Simple, testable, and works 100%

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Basic Vault

Use existing `createSplitterVault` from basic factory

- ✅ Works perfectly
- ✅ Vault is initialized with tokens
- ✅ Can deposit immediately

### Step 2: Enable Automation (Optional)

After vault creation, call:

- `enableScheduledDeposits(config)` - if user wants scheduled deposits
- `enableSavingsStrategy(config)` - if user wants savings strategy
- `addGas(amount)` - add gas reserve for automation

### Step 3: Manage Automation

- `pauseAutomation()` - pause all automation
- `resumeAutomation()` - resume automation
- `addGas(amount)` - add more gas
- `withdrawGas(amount)` - withdraw unused gas

## Benefits

- ✅ Uses proven working factory
- ✅ Each step is simple and testable
- ✅ User has full control
- ✅ Can enable/disable features anytime
- ✅ No complex initialization issues

## User Flow

1. User creates vault with tokens (1 transaction)
2. User optionally enables automation features (1-2 transactions)
3. User can modify automation anytime

This is MUCH better than trying to do everything in one transaction!
