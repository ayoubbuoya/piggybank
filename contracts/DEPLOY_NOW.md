# Deploy NOW - Simple Solution

## Problem
The factory with automation is too large to deploy (~200KB causes stack overflow).

## Solution
Deploy the basic factory first (without automation) - it's only ~80KB and will deploy successfully.

## Steps

### 1. Temporarily Use Basic Factory

```bash
cd contracts/assembly/contracts

# Backup current factory
cp factory.ts factory-with-automation.ts.backup

# Use basic factory
cp factory-basic.ts factory.ts
```

### 2. Build and Deploy

```bash
cd ../..  # Back to contracts root
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### 3. Update Frontend

Copy the deployed factory address to `frontend/.env`:
```
VITE_SMART_CONTRACT=<your_deployed_factory_address>
```

### 4. Test

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

Test creating vaults, depositing, and withdrawing.

## What Works

‚úÖ Create splitter vaults
‚úÖ Deposit funds
‚úÖ Automatic token splitting via EagleFi
‚úÖ Withdraw tokens
‚úÖ All basic functionality

## What Doesn't Work (Yet)

‚ùå Automated vaults (DCA, scheduled deposits, savings strategies)
‚ùå Automation monitoring
‚ùå Gas management

## Adding Automation Later

Once basic functionality is tested and working, we can add automation using a separate deployment or upgraded architecture.

## Restore Full Factory

When ready to work on automation again:

```bash
cd contracts/assembly/contracts
cp factory-with-automation.ts.backup factory.ts
```

## Why This Approach

1. **Unblocks you immediately** - You can test the core functionality now
2. **Validates the system** - Ensures basic vault creation works
3. **Buys time** - We can properly architect the automation deployment
4. **Pragmatic** - Better to have working basic features than broken advanced features

## Expected Output

```
Deploying contract...
Factory Contract deployed at: AS12xxxxxxxxxxxxx...
```

Copy that address to your frontend `.env` and you're ready to test!

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. Test vault creation in frontend
2. Test deposits and token splitting
3. Verify withdrawals work
4. Then we can tackle automation deployment properly

**This will work. Let's get you unblocked!** üöÄ
