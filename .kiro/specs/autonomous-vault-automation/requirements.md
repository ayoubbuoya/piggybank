# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces autonomous vault automation capabilities leveraging Massa's deferred call functionality. Users will be able to create vaults with programmatic, self-executing strategies including Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and scheduled deposits. These vaults will operate autonomously without requiring manual user intervention, enabling sophisticated savings and investment strategies on the Massa blockchain.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Deferred Call Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement Massa's deferred call functionality in the vault contracts, so that vaults can execute operations autonomously at scheduled times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a vault is created with automation enabled THEN the contract SHALL store deferred call configuration parameters
2. WHEN scheduling a deferred operation THEN the contract SHALL use Massa's native deferred call mechanism to schedule future execution
3. WHEN a deferred call executes THEN the contract SHALL verify the caller is the contract itself to prevent unauthorized execution
4. IF a deferred call fails THEN the contract SHALL emit an event with error details and attempt to reschedule if configured
5. WHEN a deferred operation completes THEN the contract SHALL schedule the next occurrence if it's a recurring operation

### Requirement 2: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Vaults

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create DCA vaults that automatically purchase tokens at regular intervals, so that I can implement a consistent investment strategy without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a DCA vault THEN the user SHALL specify purchase amount, frequency (daily/weekly/monthly), target tokens, and duration
2. WHEN a DCA vault is created THEN the contract SHALL schedule the first purchase using deferred calls
3. WHEN a scheduled DCA purchase executes THEN the contract SHALL swap the specified amount from WMAS to target tokens according to vault percentages
4. WHEN a DCA purchase completes THEN the contract SHALL automatically schedule the next purchase if the vault duration hasn't expired
5. IF a DCA vault has insufficient balance THEN the contract SHALL emit an event and pause further purchases until funded
6. WHEN a DCA vault duration expires THEN the contract SHALL stop scheduling new purchases and emit a completion event

### Requirement 3: Scheduled Programmatic Deposits

**User Story:** As a user, I want to schedule automatic deposits from my wallet to my vault at regular intervals, so that I can automate my savings without remembering to deposit manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up scheduled deposits THEN the user SHALL specify deposit amount, frequency, source wallet, and end date
2. WHEN a scheduled deposit is configured THEN the user SHALL approve the vault contract to transfer tokens on their behalf
3. WHEN a scheduled deposit executes THEN the contract SHALL transfer the specified amount from the user's wallet to the vault
4. WHEN a deposit completes successfully THEN the contract SHALL trigger the vault's distribution logic and schedule the next deposit
5. IF a scheduled deposit fails due to insufficient balance or allowance THEN the contract SHALL emit an event and retry after a grace period
6. WHEN the user cancels scheduled deposits THEN the contract SHALL remove all pending deferred calls for that schedule

### Requirement 4: Self-Executing Savings Strategies

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure custom savings strategies that execute automatically, so that I can implement sophisticated financial plans without ongoing management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a savings strategy THEN the user SHALL define strategy type (accumulation/distribution/hybrid), rules, and triggers
2. WHEN an accumulation strategy is active THEN the contract SHALL automatically increase deposit amounts over time according to configured growth rate
3. WHEN a distribution strategy is active THEN the contract SHALL automatically withdraw and transfer funds to specified addresses on schedule
4. WHEN a hybrid strategy is configured THEN the contract SHALL support both accumulation and distribution phases with automatic transition
5. WHEN strategy conditions are met THEN the contract SHALL execute the defined actions autonomously via deferred calls
6. WHEN a strategy completes its lifecycle THEN the contract SHALL emit a completion event and optionally transition to a new strategy

### Requirement 5: Vault Automation Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view, modify, and cancel automated vault operations, so that I maintain control over my vault's autonomous behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a vault with automation THEN the user SHALL see all scheduled operations with next execution times
2. WHEN modifying automation settings THEN the user SHALL be able to update frequency, amounts, and target allocations
3. WHEN automation settings are modified THEN the contract SHALL cancel existing deferred calls and reschedule with new parameters
4. WHEN pausing automation THEN the user SHALL be able to temporarily stop all scheduled operations without losing configuration
5. WHEN resuming automation THEN the contract SHALL reschedule operations from the current time forward
6. WHEN canceling automation THEN the contract SHALL remove all deferred calls and emit a cancellation event

### Requirement 6: Gas Management for Deferred Calls

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to manage gas costs for deferred operations efficiently, so that my automated vaults remain cost-effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduling a deferred call THEN the contract SHALL calculate and reserve sufficient gas for execution
2. WHEN a vault is created with automation THEN the user SHALL deposit an initial gas reserve for deferred operations
3. WHEN gas reserves run low THEN the contract SHALL emit a warning event before operations fail
4. WHEN a user adds gas to their vault THEN the contract SHALL update the available gas balance for future operations
5. IF a deferred call fails due to insufficient gas THEN the contract SHALL emit an event and pause automation until gas is added
6. WHEN automation is canceled THEN the contract SHALL return unused gas reserves to the vault owner

### Requirement 7: Frontend Integration for Automation

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface to configure and monitor automated vault operations, so that I can easily set up and track my autonomous strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a vault THEN the UI SHALL provide options to enable DCA and scheduled deposits
2. WHEN configuring automation THEN the UI SHALL validate parameters and show estimated gas costs
3. WHEN viewing a vault dashboard THEN the UI SHALL display upcoming scheduled operations with countdown timers
4. WHEN automation executes THEN the UI SHALL show execution history with timestamps and results
5. WHEN gas reserves are low THEN the UI SHALL display a prominent warning with option to add gas
6. WHEN modifying automation THEN the UI SHALL show a preview of changes before confirming
