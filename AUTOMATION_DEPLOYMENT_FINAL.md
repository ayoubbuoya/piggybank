# ‚úÖ AUTOMATION DEPLOYMENT - FINAL SOLUTION

## Summary

I've prepared everything for you to deploy automation features. The solution uses **two factories** because a single factory with both features is too large (218KB).

## What's Ready

### ‚úÖ Contracts

- `factory-basic.ts` - Already deployed (creates standard vaults)
- `factory-automation-only.ts` - Ready to deploy (creates automated vaults)

### ‚úÖ Frontend

- Updated to support two factories
- `automationService.ts` uses `VITE_AUTOMATION_FACTORY` when available
- `.env` prepared with placeholders

### ‚úÖ Deployment Scripts

- `deploy-automation-factory.sh` - Linux/Mac
- Manual deployment instructions for Windows

## Deploy Automation Factory NOW

### Windows (Your System)

```cmd
cd contracts

REM Copy automation-only factory
copy assembly\contracts\factory-automation-only.ts assembly\contracts\factory.ts

REM Build
npm run build

REM Deploy
npm run deploy
```

### Linux/Mac

```bash
cd contracts
chmod +x deploy-automation-factory.sh
./deploy-automation-factory.sh
```

## After Deployment

1. **Copy the deployed address** from the output
2. **Update `frontend/.env`**:
   ```env
   VITE_AUTOMATION_FACTORY=<your_deployed_address>
   ```
3. **Restart frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## How It Works

### Creating Standard Vaults

- Uses `VITE_SMART_CONTRACT` (basic factory)
- Calls `createSplitterVault()`
- No automation features

### Creating Automated Vaults

- Uses `VITE_AUTOMATION_FACTORY` (automation factory)
- Calls `createAutomatedVault()`
- Full automation: DCA, scheduled deposits, savings

The frontend automatically uses the correct factory based on whether automation is enabled.

## Contract Sizes

| Contract                | Size   | Status             |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Basic Factory           | 117KB  | ‚úÖ Deployed        |
| Automation Factory      | ~130KB | üîÑ Ready to deploy |
| Combined (doesn't work) | 218KB  | ‚ùå Too large       |

## Features Available After Deployment

### ‚úÖ Basic Vaults (Already Working)

- Create splitter vaults
- Deposit funds
- Token splitting via EagleFi
- Withdrawals

### ‚úÖ Automated Vaults (After Deployment)

- DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)
- Scheduled deposits
- Savings strategies (accumulation/distribution)
- Gas management
- Automation monitoring
- Execution history
- Pause/resume controls

## Expected Output

When you deploy the automation factory, you should see:

```
Deploying contract...
Factory Contract deployed at: AS12xxxxxxxxxxxxx...
```

Copy that address to `VITE_AUTOMATION_FACTORY` in your `.env`.

## Testing

After deployment:

1. **Go to Create Vault page**
2. **Enable automation** (checkbox)
3. **Configure DCA, scheduled deposits, or savings**
4. **Create vault**
5. **Monitor automation** on vault details page

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing export createAutomatedVault"

- Make sure `VITE_AUTOMATION_FACTORY` is set in `.env`
- Restart the frontend dev server

### "Insufficient funds"

- Need ~0.3 MAS for deployment
- Check wallet balance

### Still too large?

- The automation-only factory should be ~130KB
- If it fails, we can optimize further

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Both contracts are small enough** - Each under 150KB
2. **Clean separation** - Basic vs Advanced features
3. **No code duplication** - Each factory has one job
4. **Easy to maintain** - Update each independently
5. **Scalable** - Can add more specialized factories

## Cost Breakdown

- Basic Factory: 0.1 MAS (already deployed)
- Automation Factory: ~0.3 MAS (deploy now)
- **Total: ~0.4 MAS**

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy automation factory** (instructions above)
2. **Update `.env`** with the address
3. **Test creating automated vaults**
4. **Enjoy full automation features!** üéâ

## Support

If deployment fails:

- Check wallet has sufficient MAS
- Verify `.env` has correct `WALLET_SECRET_KEY`
- Try increasing gas/coins in deploy script
- Let me know the error message
